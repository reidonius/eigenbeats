#| IDEAS / TODO list for EigenBeats

1. "Push" instruments - instruments which send a sound to a stream asynchronously
   in response only to user input --> DONE

2. "Pull" instruments - instruments which produce a fixed amount of sound to be queued, when asked

3. Think about which properties of an instrument/playcanvas should be stored in the playcanvas,
   and which should be stored in the instrument. This will become important when we want to actually
   record/store things played on an instrument. The parameters/state must be kept somewhere
   to make the sounds reproducible.
